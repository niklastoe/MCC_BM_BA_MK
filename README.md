# Comparison of Matthews correlation coefficient, bookmaker's informedness, balanced accuracy and markedness

This repository contains the necessary jupyter notebooks to recreate the figures from our manuscrpt from scratch.

* `MCC_BM_BA_MK_samples.ipynb` samples millions of confusion matrices and plots the corresponding metric values 
* `BM_measures_randomness_MCC_and_MK_donot.ipynb` simulates classifiers with known degrees of information/randomness and shows the corresponding metric values for them
